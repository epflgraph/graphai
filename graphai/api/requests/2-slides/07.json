The elements of water (M, 18) are deleted when the amino acid is incorporated into a polypeptide\ntA scale combining hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of groups. The values reflect the free energy (AG) of transfer of the amino acid side chain from a hydrophobic solvent to water. This transfer is favorable (AG\n0; negative value in the index) for charged or polar amino acid side chains, and unfavorable (AG > positive value in the index) for amino acids with nonpolar or more hydrophobic side chains.

This reflects the ability of the sulfhydryl group to act as a weak acid and to form a weak hydrogen bond with oxygen or nitrogen.\n. a\nTable 3-1\nLehninger Principles of Biochemistry, Fifth Edition\n2008 W.
